# [Code.Movie](https://code.movie) plugin for [Marked](https://marked.js.org/)

Author animated code examples with markdown! This plugin extends markdown with a
wrapper syntax for fenced code blocks:

    ````code-movie|json

    ```
    []
    ```

    ```
    ["World"]
    ```

    ```
    ["Hello", "World"]
    ```

    ```
    [
      "Hello",
      "World"
    ]
    ```

    ````

With just a little configuration this turns into animated, syntax highlighted
code:

## Installation

You can install the library as `@codemovie/code-movie-marked-plugin` from NPM,
[download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/CodeMovie/code-movie-marked-plugin/releases)
or just grab `index.js` [from the source code](https://github.com/CodeMovie/code-movie-marked-plugin/tree/main/dist).

## Setup

**This plugin does _not_ bundle the core library!** You have to either manually
install [@codemovie/code-movie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codemovie/code-movie)
or load the relevant files from a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
as shown below:

```javascript
// Import Marked and the plugin
import { marked } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@15.0.6/lib/marked.esm.js";
import { markedCodeMoviePlugin } from "./plugin/code-movie-marked-plugin/index.js";
// For flexibility reasons, the plugin does not ship with the main library.
// You need to load the required functions, themes and language modules from
// somewhere, either a CDN as shown below or from your local installation of
// @codemovie/code-movie.
import {
  animateHTML,
  monokaiDark,
} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/index.js";
import json from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/languages/json.js";
import ecmascript from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/languages/ecmascript.js";

// The plugin can automatically add markup for <code-movie-runtime> custom
// elements, but this too requires the module for the element to be loaded
import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie-runtime";

// Set the options for the plugin
const codeMoviePlugin = markedCodeMoviePlugin({
  // Because the core library is not bundled with the plugin, you need to
  // provide an adapter function. The adapter function is called with the array
  // of frame objects, the relevant language object, and the Marked token for
  // the animation. You can pass the first two arguments on to your particular
  // version of the core library. The token might be interesting if you want to
  // run `animateHTML()` with different arguments depending on metadata present
  // in the token. If you want to tweak the tab size, theme, or run some side
  // effects (maybe depending on the aforementioned metadata), this is the place
  // to do that. You can also add extra HTML before, after, or around the
  // output... or not call `animateHTML()` at all, but rather do something else
  // with the raw data.
  adapter(frames, language, token) {
    return animateHTML(frames, {
      tabSize: 2,
      language,
      theme: monokaiDark,
    });
  },

  // Because the language modules are HUGE and can be configured in a variety
  // of ways, you may want to be selective about what you include and how you
  // configure each language.
  languages: {
    // Every entry in the languages object maps a class name ("json" in this
    // case) to a language module instance. To then create an animation for
    // JSON, you'll need an element with the class "code-movie" (as defined in
    // the selector option above) and also the class "json". <pre> elements
    // inside this element (again, as defined by the selector option) will
    // then be processed and animated als JSON.
    json: json(),

    // Here, the class "javascript" maps to the ecmascript module with types
    // disabled, while the class "typescript" maps to the same language
    // module, but with types enabled.
    javascript: ecmascript({ ts: false }),
    typescript: ecmascript({ ts: true }),
  },

  // To automatically add markup for <code-movie-runtime> custom elements, set
  // the "addRuntime" option to something truthy. To initialize the
  // <code-movie-runtime> tags with the "controls" attribute, pass an object
  // with the controls property set to something truthy. If you need more
  // customization, consider extending the adapter function.
  addRuntime: {
    controls: true,
  },
});

// Pass the plugin to Marked. Done!
marked.use(codeMoviePlugin);

// Time to parse some markdown...
const markdown = await fetch("./content.md").then((res) => res.text());
document.body.innerHTML += marked.parse(markdown);
```

## [Decorations](https://code.movie/docs/guides/decorations.html)

You can add decorations as [JSON5-encoded objects](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5)
to the individual code blocks inside a `code-movie` block. This can be a single
decoration object or arrays of objects. The`data` fields are optional and
default to empty objects.

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
    ````code-movie|json

    ```
    []
    ```

    ```|decorations={ kind: "TEXT", from: 1, to: 8 }
    ["World"]
    ```

    ```|decorations=[{ kind: "TEXT", from: 1, to: 8 }, { kind: "TEXT", from: 10, to: 17, data: { class: "error" } }]
    ["Hello", "World"]
    ```

    ```|decorations=[{ kind: "GUTTER", text: "âœ…", line: 2 }, { kind: "GUTTER", text: "ðŸš«", line: 3 }]
    [
      "Hello",
      "World"
    ]
    ```

    ````

## Metadata

You can add any metadata you like as a [JSON5-encoded object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5)
to a `code-movie` block after the language. This is optional and defaults to an
empty object:

    ````code-movie|json|meta={ value: 42 }

    ```
    [23]
    ```

    ```
    [42]
    ```

    ````

The object can contain line breaks.

Metadata has no immediate effect, but is is available as `token.meta` in the
adapter function. You could use to control markup creation (to eg. allow ad-hoc
addition of [custom properties](https://code.movie/docs/reference/css-variables.html))
or switch themes entirely.

## Customization

You can read up on [styling and theming in the Code.Movie documentation!](https://code.movie/docs/guides/styling.html)
