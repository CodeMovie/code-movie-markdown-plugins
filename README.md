# [Code.Movie](https://code.movie) plugin for [Marked](https://marked.js.org/)

Author animated code examples with markdown! This plugin extends markdown with a
wrapper syntax for fenced code blocks:

    !!!json

    ```
    []
    ```

    ```
    ["World"]
    ```

    ```
    ["Hello", "World"]
    ```

    ```
    [
      "Hello",
      "World"
    ]
    ```

    !!!

Combined with a moderate amount of plugin configuration the above turns into
animated, syntax highlighted code:

## Installation

You can install the library as `@codemovie/code-movie-marked-plugin` from NPM,
[download the latest release from GitHub](https://github.com/CodeMovie/code-movie-marked-plugin/releases)
or just grab `index.js` [from the source code](https://github.com/CodeMovie/code-movie-marked-plugin/tree/main/dist).

## Demo

After installation, run `npm demo` and visit [localhost:3000/demo/index.html](http://localhost:3000/demo/index.html)
for a simple demo page. The source code is unminified and has extensive
comments.

## Setup

**This plugin does _not_ bundle the core library!** You have to either manually
install [@codemovie/code-movie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@codemovie/code-movie)
or load the relevant files from a CDN like [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)
as shown below:

```javascript
// Import Marked and the plugin
import { marked } from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/marked@15.0.6/lib/marked.esm.js";
import { markedCodeMoviePlugin } from "./plugin/code-movie-marked-plugin/index.js";
// For flexibility reasons, the plugin does not ship with the main library.
// You need to load the required functions, themes and language modules from
// somewhere, either a CDN as shown below or from your local installation of
// @codemovie/code-movie.
import {
  animateHTML,
  monokaiDark,
} from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/index.js";
import json from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/languages/json.js";
import ecmascript from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie/dist/languages/ecmascript.js";

// The plugin can automatically add markup for <code-movie-runtime> custom
// elements, but this too requires the module for the element to be loaded
import "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@codemovie/code-movie-runtime";

// Set the options for the plugin
const codeMoviePlugin = markedCodeMoviePlugin({
  // Because the core library is not bundled with the plugin, you need to
  // provide an adapter function. The adapter function is called with the array
  // of frame objects, the relevant language object, and the Marked token for
  // the animation. You can pass the first two arguments on to your particular
  // version of the core library. The token might be interesting if you want to
  // run `animateHTML()` with different arguments depending on metadata present
  // in the token. If you want to tweak the tab size, theme, or run some side
  // effects (maybe depending on the aforementioned metadata), this is the place
  // to do that. You can also add extra HTML before, after, or around the
  // output... or not call `animateHTML()` at all, but rather do something else
  // with the raw data.
  adapter(frames, language, token) {
    return animateHTML(frames, {
      tabSize: 2,
      language,
      theme: monokaiDark,
    });
  },

  // Because the language modules are HUGE and can be configured in a variety
  // of ways, you may want to be selective about what you include and how you
  // configure each language.
  languages: {
    // Every entry in the languages object maps a class name ("json" in this
    // case) to a language module instance. To then create an animation for
    // JSON, you'll need an element with the class "code-movie" (as defined in
    // the selector option above) and also the class "json". <pre> elements
    // inside this element (again, as defined by the selector option) will
    // then be processed and animated als JSON.
    json: json(),

    // Here, the class "javascript" maps to the ecmascript module with types
    // disabled, while the class "typescript" maps to the same language
    // module, but with types enabled.
    javascript: ecmascript({ ts: false }),
    typescript: ecmascript({ ts: true }),
  },

  // To automatically add markup for <code-movie-runtime> custom elements, set
  // the "addRuntime" option to something truthy. To initialize the
  // <code-movie-runtime> tags with the "controls" attribute, pass an object
  // with the controls property set to something truthy. If you need more
  // customization, consider extending the adapter function.
  addRuntime: {
    controls: true,
  },
});

// Pass the plugin to Marked. Done!
marked.use(codeMoviePlugin);

// Time to parse some markdown...
const markdown = await fetch("./content.md").then((res) => res.text());
document.body.innerHTML += marked.parse(markdown);
```

## Syntax

The animation comprises of **a wrapper block** that, similar to fenced code
blocks, starts and ends with `!!!`. The desired programming language comes after
the opening trio of exclamation points. The animations keyframes are built up
from **code blocks**. These can be either regular fenced code blocks or an
extended variant that we will cover shortly.

The most basic example therefore looks as follows:

    !!!json

    ```
    "Code block content, first keyframe"
    ```

    ```
    "Code Block content, second keyframe"
    ```

    !!!

Both the wrapper block and the code blocks can take **arguments**. These are
pairs of keys and [JSON5-encoded values](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5),
wrapped in parenthesis, that pass additional information. Keys always start with
a pipe (`|`) symbol and are always immediately followed by an equals sign (`=`).
Currently there are two arguments available:

- **`|meta=`** for both wrapper and code blocks
- **`|decorations=`** for code blocks only

Example:

    !!!json(|meta={ value: "This is metadata for the wrapper" })

    ```(|meta={ value: "This is metadata for the first frame" })
    "Code block content, first keyframe"
    ```

    ```(
      |meta={
        value: "This is metadata for the second frame. With whitespace!"
      }
    )
    "Code Block content, second keyframe"
    ```

    !!!

Data from `|meta` can be used as `token.meta` in the adapter function, while
`|decorations` is specifically for
[Decorations](https://code.movie/docs/guides/decorations.html). Both types of
arguments are explained in more detail below. The arguments lists can contain
whitespace

### Metadata: `|meta`

You can add any metadata you like as a [JSON5-encoded object](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5)
to a **wrapper block** or **code block**. The argument is always optional and
defaults to an empty object:

    !!!json(|meta={ value: "Metadata for the entire animation" })

    ```(|meta={ value: "Metadata for the first frame" })
    [23]
    ```

    ```(|meta={ value: "Metadata for the second frame" })
    [42]
    ```

    !!!

The object can contain line breaks.

#### `|meta` on wrapper blocks

Metadata on wrapper blocks has no immediate effect, but is is available as
`token.meta` in the adapter function. You could use to control markup creation
(to eg. allow ad-hoc addition of [custom properties](https://code.movie/docs/reference/css-variables.html))
or switch [themes](https://code.movie/docs/reference/themes.html) entirely.

#### `|meta` on code blocks

Metadata on code blocks has no immediate effect, but gets added to the `meta`
property on the frame objects available in the adapter function.

### [Decorations](https://code.movie/docs/guides/decorations.html): `|decorations`

You can add decorations as [JSON5-encoded arrays](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json5)
to the individual code blocks inside a `code-movie` block. The`data` fields are
optional and default to empty objects.

    !!!json

    ```
    []
    ```

    ```(|decorations=[{ kind: "TEXT", from: 1, to: 8 }])
    ["World"]
    ```

    ```(|decorations=[
      { kind: "TEXT", from: 1, to: 8 },
      { kind: "TEXT", from: 10, to: 17, data: { class: "error" } }
    ])
    ["Hello", "World"]
    ```

    ```(|decorations=[
      { kind: "GUTTER", text: "âœ…", line: 2 },
      { kind: "GUTTER", text: "ðŸš«", line: 3 }
    ])
    [
      "Hello",
      "World"
    ]
    ```

    !!!

Neither the decoration objects nor the containing array can currently contain line breaks.

### Language

Languages on code blocks are not required, but you might want to add them anyway
to enable syntax highlighting in your code editor.

    !!!json

    ```json
    ["The language is not needed, but maybe you want it"]
    ```

    ```json (
      |meta={ info: "Frame 1" }
      |decorations=[{ kind: "TEXT", from: 1, to: 8 }]
    )
    ["Note that a space between the language and the arguments is valid!"]
    ```

    !!!
